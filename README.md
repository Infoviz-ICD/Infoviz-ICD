As the historical and biographical reconstructions of main European and US art dealers is still ongoing by scholars, not always bibliographical resources were founded. The main pieces of information about the dealers are hence coming from the online articles published by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and, in the worst scenarios, from online encyclopedias (Wikipedia).
